# simplyPsycho
simplyPsycho Library for UW

To Do:
 - Include option in data selection(Matched = TRUE) to enforce ordering of 
    terms. For example, a student who took 121 and 122 in 200 and 201, respectively,
    would be included. Where as a student who took them in 201 and 200 would not. 
    (I know, terrible example, but it gets the point across.)

 - Include bar chart option to gen.model.normal function. (makeBarChart, nBins)
