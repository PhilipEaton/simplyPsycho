\title{Select specific course from the pulled PIQL data.}
\usage{
piql.data.select(
  pulled.PIQL.data,
  MCMR.grading = "Dichotomous",
  MCMR.items = c(15:20),
  courses = 1,
  numBlanks.allowed = 0,
  Matched = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pulled.PIQL.data}{Output from pullPQLdata}

\item{MCMR.grading}{(Default = "Dichotomous") If undefined, then MCMR items will be graded dichotomously.

If MCMR.grading = "Selected", then the correct options to the indicated MCMR items
will be included in the output as their own columns (e.g., Q17A and Q17C) populated
with 0's and 1's. 0 = student DID NOT select the option, and 1 = student did select the option.

If MCMR.grading = "FourScale", then MCMR items will be graded o the 4 scale:
(0 = completely incorrect, 1 = correct and incorrect, 2 = some correct, 3 = completely correct)}

\item{MCMR.items}{Which items are MCMR. Defaulted to PIQL (15 through 20).}

\item{numBlanks.allowed}{(default = 0) Number of blanks allowed in the resulting data.}

\item{Matched}{(Default = FALSE). If TRUE, only matching student IDs will be extracted
across all courses.}

\item{course}{(Default = 1 = 121) Course number (1 = 121, 2 = 122, 3 = 123, etc.) or position in course list:

Course: 121, 122, 123, 141, 142, 143, 224, 225, 226, 321, 322, 323, 325

For all courses in the data set to "all" (include quotations).}
}
\value{
A list of course data for the PIQL stored in AWS.

     $data.alpha ALPHABETICAL data for the selected course.

     $data.num NUMERICAL data for the selected course.

     $nS.details Details about how many students were removed due to the specified numBlanks.allowed value.
}
\description{
Selects a specific course from the pulled PIQL data and separates
the correct MCMR options marked 1 if they were selected and 0 if they were not.
